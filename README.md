## Overview  
This project builds an **automated fraud finance monitoring system** for a mid-sized financial institution.  
The system integrates **n8n (workflow automation)**, **Supabase (database)**, **Quadratic**, **Google Sheets**, and **Looker Studio** to monitor customer activity, loans, and transactions in real time.  

The goal is to detect **suspicious behavior, default risk, and fraud patterns** early, while also improving business insights into customer and loan performance.  

---

## Business Problem  
Financial institutions face increasing risks of:  
- Rising defaults from high-risk borrowers  
- Fraudulent loan applications and suspicious payment reversals  
- Inefficient loan portfolio management  

This project addresses these issues by:  
1. **Monitoring transactions in real-time** to detect red flags.  
2. **Identifying risky customers** with declining creditworthiness.  
3. **Improving decision-making** on loan products and underwriting.  

---

## Dataset  
- **Customers** â†’ Demographics, credit score, annual income, region, acquisition date  
- **Loans** â†’ Loan amount, term, purpose, interest rate, repayment status  
- **Transactions** â†’ Payment history, payment delays, chargebacks, reversals  

Data is stored in **Supabase** and connected to **Looker Studio** dashboards.  
Sample CSVs are included in `/data/`.  

---

## Tools & Technologies  
- **n8n** â†’ Automation & ETL pipelines  
- **Supabase** â†’ PostgreSQL backend for customer, loan & transaction data  
- **Quadratic** â†’ Spreadsheet-based data modeling  
- **Google Sheets** â†’ Lightweight integration for real-time sync  
- **Looker Studio** â†’ Dashboards, reporting & AI-generated summaries  
- **Python (optional)** â†’ Data analysis, anomaly detection, and EDA

## Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Removed **negative or zero values** (income â‰¤ 0, loan amount â‰¤ 0).  
- Handled **outliers** in high-income/low-credit-score clusters.  
- Flagged **single-day sign-up spikes** (possible fraud).  
- Standardized column formats (dates, currencies, IDs).  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Demographics:** Majority of borrowers are 30â€“45 yrs; fastest growth in Pacific Northwest.  
- **Loans:** Default rate increased to 5.2% (from 3.5% earlier). 60-month terms = highest risk.  
- **Transactions:** Late payments up by 18%, average delay = 12 days. Payment reversals trending upward.  
- **Fraud Signals:** Nevada cohort showed suspicious sign-ups + payment chargebacks.  

---

## Research Questions & Key Findings  
1. **Which loan types are most profitable vs. risky?**  
   â†’ Home Improvement loans = safest (1.8% default). Debt Consolidation = riskiest.  

2. **Are new customer cohorts riskier?**  
   â†’ Yes. New borrowersâ€™ credit scores dropped from 710 â†’ 685.  

3. **Can fraud be linked to customer acquisition anomalies?**  
   â†’ Yes. Nevada spike linked with chargebacks â†’ possible fraud ring.  

4. **What behavioral patterns indicate distress?**  
   â†’ Customers making multiple small payments instead of scheduled ones = high-risk indicator.  

---

## Dashboard  
Looker Studio Dashboard tracks:  
- **Customer Profiles** (demographics, credit score trends, geography)  
- **Loan Performance** (defaults, terms, profitability by type)  
- **Transaction Monitoring** (late payments, reversals, fraud signals)  
- **AI-Generated Insights** (Gemini AI summaries integrated in dashboard bottom section)

## How to Run This Project  

### 1. Clone the repository  
- git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-finance-monitoring.git
- cd fraud-finance-monitoring

2. (Optional) Install Python dependencies
 - pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Setup Supabase
- Import /sql/schema.sql into your Supabase project.
- Upload /data/*.csv as seed data.

4. Import n8n workflows
- Import flows from /n8n_flows/ to automate data sync (Supabase â†” Sheets).

5. Open Dashboard
- Connect Looker Studio to Supabase/Sheets.

## Final Recommendations
- Tighten underwriting criteria for borrowers <690 credit score & long-term loans.
- Investigate fraud patterns (Nevada cohort, payment reversals).
- Proactive customer retention: Offer deferrals/modifications to distressed customers.
- Optimize loan marketing: Promote Home Improvement loans; review Business loan exposure.
- System audit: Fix anomalies in loan pricing (e.g., abnormally low interest rates).
- Import dashboard template from /dashboard/.
